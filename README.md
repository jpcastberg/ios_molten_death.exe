# ios_molten_death.exe
Front end for my radio station written in Swift.<br>

I wanted an application that would properly pipe currently playing song metadata from my Icecast radio stream into iOS, so I could view album art, song elapsed/duration, properly formatted artist/song title, as well has control the Azuracast "skip" feature from the iOS ui. This is that solution!<br>
